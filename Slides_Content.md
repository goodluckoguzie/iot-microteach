## Slide 1: Title Slide
**Title:** Introduction to IoT: Building a Smart Home Security System
**Subtitle:** Micro-Teach Session
**Presenter:** [Your Name]
**Image:** (Optional: A simple icon of a padlock or wifi symbol)

## Slide 2: Learning Objectives
**Title:** Learning Objectives
**Text:**
By the end of this session, students will be able to:
1.  **Define** the basic concept of Internet of Things (IoT).
2.  **Identify** the components of a simple sensor circuit (Input vs. Output).
3.  **Construct** a motion-detection logic using an Arduino microcontroller.

## Slide 3: What is IoT?
**Title:** What is the Internet of Things (IoT)?
**Text:**
*   **Definition:** The network of physical objects ("things") embedded with sensors and software to connect and exchange data.
*   **Key Components:**
    *   **Sensors:** "The Eyes" (Gather data).
    *   **Connectivity:** "The Transport" (Send data).
    *   **Processing:** "The Brain" (Make decisions).
*   **Real World Example:** Smart Thermostats, Wearable Health Trackers, Connected Cars.

## Slide 4: The Scenario (The Hook)
**Title:** The Challenge: Home Security
**Text:**
*   **Problem:** We want to know if an intruder enters our home when we are away.
*   **Solution:** A "Motion-Activated Alarm System".
*   **How it works:**
    *   **Input:** Passive Infrared (PIR) Sensor detects body heat.
    *   **Process:** Arduino checks "Is there motion?"
    *   **Output:** IF yes -> Turn on Red Light (Alarm).

## Slide 5: The Circuit Diagram
**Title:** Our Circuit Blueprint
**Image:** (Paste a screenshot of your Tinkercad circuit here BEFORE you start the live demo)
**Notes:**
*   **Input:** PIR Sensor (Pin 2).
*   **Output:** LED (Pin 13).
*   **Controller:** Arduino Uno.

## Slide 6: Summary & Next Steps (Show AFTER Demo)
**Title:** Summary & Next Steps
**Text:**
*   **Re-cap:** We successfully built a logical system: **Input (Sensor) -> Process (Code) -> Output (Actuator)**.
*   **Next Session (Hands-On):**
    *   We will move from Simulation to **Physical Hardware**.
    *   You will wire this circuit using the real Arduino kits.
    *   We will learn about electrical safety and sensor calibration.
*   **Any Questions?**
